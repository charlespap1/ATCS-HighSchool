Traveling Salesman Project

In order to run and test my traveling salesman project, open the TravelingSalesman.html 
file, enter the number of dots you would like into the top box and then press create dots. 
After the dots are created, you can use the buttons to run each algorithm one by one. I 
initially struggled getting up and running with this project because it took a little 
while to get the hang of html and javascript. Once i did, the project was relatively easy 
and i feel that i understood it well. My only issue was that I was stuck on smallest 
Increase for a little while due to an unknown error but thankfully that has been resolved. 
I feel that i learned a lot on this project about html and javascript and how to code 
in them.
